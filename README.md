# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis (Excel-based)

An Excel-powered exploratory project that analyzes customer churn behavior using demographic segmentation, product portfolio profiles, and RFM clustering to uncover hidden risk factors and drive retention strategies in the banking sector.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **High RFM segments (e.g., 5-5-4) show unexpected churn** — loyalty gaps exist due to unmet post-purchase experience, not usage decline.  
2. **Owning 3–4 products correlates with *higher* churn** — early cross-selling may backfire without trust foundation.  
3. **Customers aged >45 have elevated churn risk** — caused by digital exclusion rather than dissatisfaction.  
4. **Germany displays structurally high churn** despite small customer base — possible market-fit mismatch.  
5. **New high-value customers churn rapidly** — root cause lies in onboarding/integration failure, not product quality.  
6. **Even long-tenured users with 3–4 products churn more** — issue lies in product sequencing, not saturation.  
7. **Single-product customers with >5 years tenure show highest loyalty** — simplicity outperforms breadth.  
8. **Mid-tier RFM clusters (e.g., 2-3-3) represent retention “sweet spots”** — ripe for habit-building interventions.

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

- **Launch a “Loyalty Recovery Protocol”** targeting at-risk high-RFM customers with exclusive benefits and RM touchpoints.  
- **Redesign cross-selling strategy** using lifecycle sequencing logic — don’t upsell too early.  
- **Introduce digital guidance programs** (simplified UX, hotline, onboarding webinars) for customers >45.  
- **Pause Germany market expansion** until customer-product fit is reassessed.  
- **Create structured onboarding journeys** for high-value new users (calls, reminders, satisfaction checks).  
- **Shift from product-based to lifecycle-based cross-sell sequencing** — defer third+ product offerings.  
- **Incentivize long-term single-product users** with premium service tiers (“Core Simplicity” loyalty segment).  
- **Deploy nudges and behavioral reinforcements** (e.g., milestone badges) for mid-RFM users to strengthen habits.
